     * As the main point of the code challenge is accomplished, and I don't think 100% test coverage is needed for such a test-challenge project,
     * I thought on explaining what would I test in case this would be a real world app.
     *
     * In this case, we have a couple of functions.
     * The first one is initializing the DocumentClient for DynamoDB. The configuration is pretty standard from aws-sdk.
     * I would mock that class, and just test that no matter how many times you call that method is returning the same instance.
     * The second is an aux method for testing, meant to clear a table.
     * I would then test it inserting some dummy data in a table, clearing it and then checking that querying the same info returns undefined
